## Description

As a group of developers with strong ties to education, we chose to create an application that solves one of the main problems within this industry, "who teaches the teachers?". Teachers everywhere need more resources, and new teachers need help with concepts and situations that may come easier for seasoned professionals. Our application solves this problem by giving teachers a safe space to ask teacher questions and receive answers that only a fellow teacher would know. Educators will be able to post questions and respond to questions based on pre-generated categories." " is a free, social application to share our united teacher knowledge.
